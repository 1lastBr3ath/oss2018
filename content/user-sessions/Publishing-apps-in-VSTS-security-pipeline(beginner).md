description  : Beginner level session on DevSecOps and publishing to the Cloud
---

For many people 'the cloud' and DevSecOps can be a bit mysterious.  Let's clear this up with a nice, long, slow demo of how to load up an app in your editor, make a change, run it through your pipeline (and pass the security checkes!), then publish it into the cloud.  One step at a time.

## WHY

Absolute beginners in DevOps can learn  how to do DevSecOps and publish to the cloud.

## What

Attendees will learn how to publish an app (DevSlop.com) using the pipeline in Visual Studio Team Server, with many security tests, into the Azure Cloud, with secure configurations


## Outcomes

Outcomes: Beginners can see an app deployment from start to finish.  Since this is all open source and part of the DevSlop project, attendees can take this code and practice at home.
