<!-- put more details about participant here -->
I will lead the threat modeling track. 

As a consultant I help organizations achieve a secure development lifecycle. 
In my spare time I'm the [OWASP threat model project leader] (https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Threat_Model_Project)

My hobbies include AI, machine learning, robotics, chatbots and arguing.
