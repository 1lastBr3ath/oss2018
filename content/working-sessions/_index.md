We passionately believe that the hard problems and challenges that our industry faces can only
be solved by working together in a collaborative and open environment.

This Summit is such an event, where the community comes together, and works tirelessly from
8am to 2am on topics that they are passionate about.

As you can see by the tracks, outcomes, attendees and photos from [last year's Summit](https://owaspsummit.org/Outcomes/)),
this explosive combination of talent, challenges and enclosed location (venue and villas) creates a highly productive environment.

Where else in the world do you find 15xThreat Modeling experts, thought-leaders and
practitioners? Where do you find the main authors of the OWASP Mobile testing guide working
together in a room on the next version? Where do you find a mix of OWASP leaders, developers,
security engineers, security champions, pentesters, architects, risk experts, business analysts
, heads of Security, CISOs, researchers (and many other roles) in the same room (or villa)
all working together, sharing knowledge and creating tangible and usable outcomes.

The format of the Summit is based on Working Sessions, which are designed to maximise
collaboration and participation. The focus and objectives of these sessions are determined by you (the onsite or remote
participant), all the summit team does is to set the stage for magic to happen :)
