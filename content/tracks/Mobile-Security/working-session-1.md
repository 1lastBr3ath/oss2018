The 1.0 release of the Mobile Application Security Verification Standard (MASVS) was [published early this year](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-masvs/releases). The MASVS establishes baseline security requirements for mobile apps that are useful in many scenarios, including:

* In the SDLC - to establish security requirements to be followed by solution architects and developers;
* In mobile app penetration tests - to ensure completeness and consistency in mobile app penetration tests;
* In procurement - as a measuring stick for mobile app security, e.g. in form of questionnaire for vendors;
* Et cetera.

Last year we were focusing on creating the security requirements for the mobie world. This year we want to automate them :-) 

The MASVS is a sister project of the [OWASP Mobile Security Testing Guide](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg).
