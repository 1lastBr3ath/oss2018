GDPR Patterns are reusable mappings of data journeys across specific threat modelling
scenarios.

It aims to support the mapping of data flows and consider security and privacy requirements
to meet EU GDPR regulation.

## WHY

Threat model diagrams are excellent sources of data mapping as they allow us to ensure a
consistent model to assess threats and controls designed to mitigate those threats.

The use of GDPR Patterns permits organizations to risk assess
data flows and select technical and organizational measures
used to meet security and privacy requirements as set by EU GDPR

## What

In order to assess threats to privacy and security and enable organisations to have a
standardized approach, thereâ€™s the need to define the detail to
each step of the patterns. The following steps are to be defined on the data model as
standard capabilities:

 - Data source
 - Categories of individuals
 - Categories of Personal data
 - Purpose of processing
 - Data Security
 - Lawful basis of processing
 - Data retention
 - Data transfer
 - Data recipients

## Outcomes
The outcome is to have a standardised data model covering all steps to security and privacy capabilities required, so the model can then be applied and tailored to each organisation and their particular capabilities and risk appetite.
