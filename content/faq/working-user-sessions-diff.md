## Difference Between Working and User Sessions

**Working Sessions** focus on creating and evolving ideas, in order to create outcomes that will have an impact in the real world. They are a great way to join a group of practitioners to share expertise and knowledge on a particular subject.

**User Sessions** are much more practical sessions, which will enable you to learn new skills or develop existing ones. They are also an opportunity to test out the outcomes of some of the Working Sessions. These are a presentation-free environment, driven by practitioners working with users.
