title    : Registering and updating information
---

#### 1. How do I update my schedule and register for working sessions?
In order to update your schedule, follow these steps:

  1. Visit your profile page. For example, http://opensecsummit.org/participant/francois-raynaud/.

  4. On the next page, add the "Working Sessions:" that you want to attend. Use a space after the colon and a space after each comma.

  5. Create a new branch for this commit, create a pull request and commit changes.

  6. When merged, changes should reflect on your main profile page after a delay of a minute or so.



#### 2. I don't have a profile page, how do I register as a participant on GitHub?

There are two types of participants -- Onsite and Remote

- To register as a remote participant:

   Please make a copy of the [remote participant template]({{< ref "/participant/remote/_template-remote.md" >}}) and save it in the same folder (https://github.com/OpenSecuritySummit/oss2018/content/participant/remote).

- To register as an onsite participant:

   Please make a copy of the [participant template]({{< ref "/participant/_template.md" >}}) and save it in the same folder (https://github.com/OpenSecuritySummit/oss2018/tree/master/content/participant).
   
If you are going to contribute to a working session it makes sense to fork the repo and make push your changes (https://github.com/OpenSecuritySummit/oss2018).
