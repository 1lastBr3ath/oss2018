title : Vendor Pitches
type : vendor-pitch

These sessions are vendor pitches, designed to provide an environment to learn more about a particular tool or service.

Vendors are key players in the Security landscape and these sessions (all happening during the Evening) allow customers and
potential customers to interact directly with the knowledgeable vendor's SMEs.

This is the only time and place where 'vendor pitches' are allowed inside the Summit environment, and if you (as participant) don't want to hear it, then
don't turn up at the villa :)
