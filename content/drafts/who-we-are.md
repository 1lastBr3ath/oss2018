## About the Open Security Summit

The Open Security Summit (OSS) was created by the organisers of the OWASP Summit, who held their first conference of this style way back in [2008](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_EU_Summit_2008), in Portugal. This year the summit showcases a rebrand, and is supported by the OWASP board. The OWASP summit was well known as the most hand-ons participant-driven conference dedicated to Application Security. The OSS will continue to bring together industry experts who are dedicated to the building security into the development processes. 

Do you work in Development, Application Security, threat modeling, DevOps, GDPR, or Web Security? Then OSS can empower you. If you would like to contribute there is a [call for submissions](link here) for this years summit.


## Smarter not faster
Lewis Carroll's Red Queen taught us as children: "here we must run as fast as we can, just to stay in place. And if you wish to go anywhere you must run twice as fast as that." IT security and regulation has never been more important or more challenging and it sees dev teams the world over running just to maintain their place. 

At OSS we are dedicated to responding with thought and insight, it is time to work smarter not harder, to slow down and get ahead. To dedicate our energies to innovation. Quick release cycles for new software, with security as add-on, must be a thing of the past. OSS works to empower devs to merge Application Development and Security seamlessly.
