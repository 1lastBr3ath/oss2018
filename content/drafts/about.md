## About OSS

OSS started life as OWASP <!-- remove reference to OSS?? -->
It has grown from its beginning in 20** <!-- date of first --->, when we hosted our collaborative conference in PLACE <!-- locaton of first --->. It is the most hand-ons participant-driven conference dedicated to SecOps <!-- what is key term AppSec/ SecOps?? --->. We bring together industry experts who are dedicated to the building security into the development processes. 

Do you work in Development, DevOps and Security? Then OSS can empower you. If you would like to contribute there is a [call for submissions](link here) for this years summit.


## Smarter not faster
Lewis Carroll's Red Queen taught us as children: "here we must run as fast as we can, just to stay in place. And if you wish to go anywhere you must run twice as fast as that." IT security and [regulation](GDPR link??) has never been more important or more challenging and it sees dev teams the world over running just to maintain their place. 

At OSS we are dedicated to responding with thought and insight, it is time to work smarter not harder. To dedicate our energies to innovation. Quick release cycles for new software, with security as add-on, must be a thing of the past. OSS works to empower devs, <!-- focus term here---> to merge Application development and Security seamlessly.
