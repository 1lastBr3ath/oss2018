## OSS 2017

You attend numerous conferences throughout your career, both as an attendee or as a speaker, and you typically get dragged into this model where most of the events follow this traditional one-to-many model. One starts questioning the actual value of majority of those events. It is not unusual to end up with tons of sponsors and their representatives doing sales pitches, or people talking about their latest research, without input or interest from the audience and no opportunity to actually dive deeper into things or discuss real-life problems.

The OSS 2017 was different. Having a place where you could go and discuss all of your actual issues and challenges was simple luxury. While discussing the upcoming Summit with a good friend of mine, what became clear is that we built a place for people to come with their actual problems. These problem were addressed by us helping them, by providing a group of top individuals from the industry that try to tackle these and come up with some constructive conclusions and possible solutions.

Information and cyber security is specifically challenging, because there is this big cloud of secrecy around the whole thing and the amount of disclosure is carefully dosed by the majority of the involved parties, which in most of the cases actually stalls innovation within the industry. Being able to contribute and get various industry experts to contribute on an issue that is your actual challenge, in your organisation, right this moment that would then get re-assessed and re-used by lot of others, represents the foundation of building a safer and more scalable tomorrow. It is actually quite reasonable to believe that with the OSS Summit we might be creating an event that might re-shape the way we solve problems within the security space.
